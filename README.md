# What is this?

This is BLAM, a camera and [video projector calibration](https://github.com/stuffmatic/blam/wiki/Video-Projector-Calibration) toolkit for [Blender](http://www.blender.org) in the form of an add-on, written in python, that facilitates modeling based on photographs.

To get development progress updates, either check back here regularly or [follow me on Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/stuffmatic).

Bugs can be reported [here](https://github.com/stuffmatic/blam/issues). 

# Getting started 

1. [Download the latest release](http://stuffmatic.github.com/) (or [get the latest git revision](https://github.com/stuffmatic/blam/blob/master/src/blam.py)).
2. [Install](https://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Extensions:2.6/Py/Scripts)
3. Check out the [introduction video](https://vimeo.com/35153437), [this tutorial video](https://vimeo.com/35421849) and [read the user's guide](https://github.com/stuffmatic/blam/wiki/User%27s-guide).

# Getting involved

The easiest way to get involved is testing the add-on and [providing bug reports](https://github.com/stuffmatic/blam/issues). [This blenderartists thread](http://blenderartists.org/forum/showthread.php?243370-Addon-Camera-matching-add-on-for-modeling-based-on-photographs&highlight=blam+camera) is a good place to provide other kinds of input, like feature suggestions

If you're interested in helping out on the coding side, let me know. 

# Getting nerdy

* The focal length and camera orientation estimation is based on [Using Vanishing Points for Camera Calibration and Coarse 3D Reconstruction from a Single Image](http://www.irisa.fr/prive/kadi/Reconstruction/paper.ps.gz) by E. Guillou, D. Meneveaux, E. Maisel, K. Bouatouch. 
* The algorithm for 3D reconstruction of rectangle based geometry is an extension of the AC algorithm described in [Recovery of Intrinsic and Extrinsic Camera Parameters Using Perspective Views of Rectangles](http://www.bmva.org/bmvc/1995/bmvc-95-017.pdf) by T. N. Tan, G. D. Sullivan and K. D. Baker. 
* BLAM does least squares solution of systems of linear equations using the pure python linear algebra routines available [here](http://users.rcn.com/python/download/python.htm) and does not depend on external packages such as scipy.
